  <h4>8/9/15</h4>

       Conflicts are part of our lives and everyone experiences them. We face conflicts in our everyday life. We might have conflicts with our neighbor that plays loud music at night, with our siblings that make a mess in your room, or with that friend that asks you for a favor, but never does one back to you. In this blog I will be talking bout a comflict that I had before and the emotions that i felt. I will also talk about how things can change or be influenced if we analyze the conflict.

     So, that being said I will talk about a conlfict I have had in the past and I will talk about the emotions I found myself being influenced by when facing it.This conflict is not necessary a big conflict, but I will talk about this particular one to medidate now about how I could have reacted or responded instead if I would have broken down and understood what exactly I was feeling. When I was younger, my older brother and I would share rooms. My brother was the messy kind of roommate. That would always make me very angry and we would always argue a lot even if it wasnt about the room being messy.

       At a young age I could not think of a good way to try to resolve the issue. I would just be mad at my brother and I treated him bad in certain ways. Maybe subsconsciously, I would treat him bad hoping that he would not like it so that he would change and clean his part. Unfortunately things dont work like that. If I could go back in time, I would explain to my brother that when he does not clean his side of the room, I feel disrespected and ignored and it causes me to get angry.
