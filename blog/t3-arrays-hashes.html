    <h3>What is a Hash?</h3>
    A hash is a structure of data which contains keys. Each key represents a value. hashes a bit different from arrays. Arrays store content by ordered index. The content in hashed is reffered key-value pairs.
    Hashes are surrounded by curly braces {} and commas separate them. The syntax for hashes is the following. My_new_hash = {name:'josue'}.
    Hashes can store more than a key-value pair. Twe can store multiple pairs as long as they are separated by commas. Like this: My_new_hash = {name:'josue', lives_in: 'CA', loves:'playing guitar', }

  <h3>What is an Array?</h3>
Arrays in ruby store content by index order. Each element in the array is reffered to by an index. I find it interesting that the count of arrays, by index, begins in 0. What I mean by this is that if we have an array with 4 lements. The index will begin counting the first element at 0 and count up to 3 at the last element.  for example array = ["idx0", "idx1", "idx2", "idx3"]. You see 4 elemets in the array but if you want to point to one element by the index you would subtract 1 from the elements postion number.
