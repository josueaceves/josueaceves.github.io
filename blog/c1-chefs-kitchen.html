      I  must admit that what I have heard about DBC has given me a sense of intimidation, but beyond that, I am excited about being challenged. Those students that have read the article about Fixed and Growth Mindset will understand the difference between that person who is  excited about new challenges that will add to one's knowledge, and that other person who tries to avoid challenges. Being intimidated to a point does that mean one dislikes  challenges, to the contrary being intimidated or confused is only natural. I personally feel very excited about what is there to come with bootcamp. My take on DBC, based on what I'm currently experiencing, and on what I've heard, is that it is a totally worth-doing life experience. I'm definitely nervous about the challenges I will go through, but as someone said: "fear is the natural reaction that one has to the unknown."

      Since the first time that I heard about DBC, I got the impression that it is a challenging program, but with a great reputation. I, personally contacted students of devbootcamp before I applied to DBC myself to get a feel for what I was shooting for. The recommendation that I got  from the students was motivational. Another thing that I think is worth mentioning is that I find DevBootCamp's integrity encouraging. If one student is honestly struggling to make it through, DBC will give that person the option of repeating the unit or dropping out and getting their money back. That itself speaks good about them.

       I find excitement in surrounding myself with different people. I love the idea of of learning everything that DBC has to teach. The environment in which DBC students are surrounded by, must be very supportive. The fact that DBC encourages students to be open about the things they don't know. They encourage students to be able to say "I don't know " without worrying about being ashamed. DBC offers a supportive environment, and culture. I can see myself engaging with this culture.
