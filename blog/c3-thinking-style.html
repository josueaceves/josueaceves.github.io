  <h1>My thinking style</h1>
  <h4>06/21/15</h4>

    <p>Based on the results of the thiking style test i took, I lean equally by 32 points, to  concrete sequential, abstract sequential, and abstract ramdom thinking. Apprently, I  learn better  with organized material. I base myself in reality and  I process information in an organized, and linear manner. I have noticed that I follow the DBC assignments very well when they are organized with instructions and with the material we have to learn. For a lot of the exercises this week, we got the intructions that stated what readigns we had to do, to be able to comple them. For other exercises, we had to learn the cocepts by ourselves with research on the web. I struggled finding a linear way to learn them rather than bits form differente sites.    </p>

<p>So far, up to this point in phas 0, I can't rally say that I have struggled so much except for the third week where we dove into ruby. I had almost zero experience with ruby and understanding while loops was challenging. I worked on exercises with other DBC students and we were able to get the exercises done, but was I really understanding everything they were adding to the solution? The answer was no, so what I had to do is get a piece of paper and write down everything that made sence in my head. Then I spent several hours to develop a solution on my own understanding every single step. I had to organize the problem in a linear way and analize every aspect of it to be able to solve it. From now on, whenever I get stuck in a problem, I will follow this strategy of laying all the datails in a linear and organized way because I believe I learn best from doing every step by myself.
