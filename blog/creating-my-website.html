       So far I have had a good experience editing and changing my personal website. Before I begun editing my website today, I felt intimidated because I knew It was going to take me a long time. It certainly did, but all my work paid off. I loved the end result of my work today. I edited the css on all of my blogs and to all the index pages in my website.

      I think the part that was a bit tedious was making sure that all the links in all the pages were working. I also realized how good Im becoming with html and css. Going back to the old blogs I wrote and looking at the css I wrote I realize that I understand it so much better than at the beginning. I saw how before I would get confused with how to target specific objects in css.

      This is only the beginning of my personal webpage. Soon I will be adding all my projects and more blogs. Eventually I will buy a domian and a host to make it public. I'm happy with the progress I've been able to accomplish today.
