      I feel that by reading feedback that I get from others, I get a better sense of how I actually am. I have to say that I enjoy reading feedback from others. I find it very helpful. I realized that at times certain things that I would do would affect others. For example, I learned from feedback that a few times when I would be pairing and If I was driving, I could easily get caught up in a problem, and in my own focus to think of soluctions, I would ignore the other student's suggestion to solve the problem. When I read this in my feedback, I felt embarrassed, but I was glad to know my mistakes so that I can correct them. I also learned from my feedback that I have not been writting efficient pseudocode. I need to write better detailed pseudocode to help me solve a problem in a more efficient way.

       Writing feedback is a bit challenging sometimes, because I always have a great time pairing and for the most part I feel like the students I pair with are great students and give it all in the session. I mean its challenging to write feedback because I find myself wanting to write the same feedback for everyone. Only a few times I had costructive feedback. Its hard to think about constructive feedback when your pairs are smart and hard working. Very few times I felt that if I had a costructive comment, it would be for myself becasue my pair would contribute more to the pairing session and I would just benifit from their understanding.

      I think that is is very helpful to be able to pair and work on problems with other people. I also believe that it is very important to try to solve most of the challenges by ourselves because that way we get to put our whole understandin to work. for me, most of the time, it is most beneficial to work on a problem by myself. I get to put my wholeself in the problem and use all the knowledge I have which allows my undestanding to strengthen. Sometimes though, I get stuck and I need help and thats where pairing helps so much because the other student might have an idea about how to solve the problem and thats where learning from others comes into play.
