      Since I got in to computer programing I kept hearing the term binary. Many of you might already know what binary is. Its the concept of values consisting of 0's and 1's. this might sound confusing but it is actually not. Below I will show some image examples that will help you understand how binary numbers are produced.

      As we have been tought in elementary school, numbers in the decimal system are placed by tenths. Each number to the left is ten times bigger than the number to the right.

  In the binary system, the numbers are created by simply adding the position diggits of the 1's. The zeros represent 0.
