       Before programers knew about version control, they would save their coding work to a local repository on their computers, but over time, they would accumulate so many directories that it made it hard to go back and specific commit. Now we have a very handy tool that allows us to easily record all of our work.We can make as many modifications as we want and save them, and yet, it records the time it was modified followed by a commit message which described what was changed.

       When we work on a program or on editing a code, we use git because it allows us to work and saves any changes made.It stores any update made to your work and allows you to record a message about what you changed. For example, the files located in the DBC Phase 0, Unit 1 show the date they were written plus a log of how many times it has been updated or changed. It shows how many commits it has had.

       If you wonder why you should use Github, you should know that Github is a code sharing and publishing service and at the heart of it is Git. Git is your command line tool and Github provides a Web-based graphical interface.  Github is a social networking site for programmers. A great example of why Github is great for storing and sharing code, is DevBootCamp. They post every curriculum for their students there and at the same time they have their students post their work in it.
