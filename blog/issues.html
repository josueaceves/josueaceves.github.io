      Online insecurity is an issue that every person who uses the web should know about. Everytime that we post to our social sites, we leave a trail of information that can be used to elaborate a theft. We dont know  how much inforamation we actually deposit into the web everyday. There have been many registered cases where thieves use social data to rob, or even worse, to kidnap people. I had been reading about how the advanced technology in new broducts is betraying consumers. We now see smart televisions, wi-fi baby camera, and even wi-fi coffee makers. Each of these products are constantly delivering your personaly data to corporate servers and hackers have been known to steal this information from corporate servers.

      Knowing that a baby wi-fi camera may be also deliering the feed to someone else is quite discomforting. It is important that we learn about security tips to to keep our date from being reached by others easily. We can minimize who views our information in our social sites. That does not mean that social sites are not collecting data about what kind of products we are likely to buy , but at least pictures and other information is not vicible to anyone. There are several websites that post live feed video of random homes and that is becuase some people dont protect their  devices with passwords or set setting to privatize unknown connections.
