      Many of us might have been through the situation of not getting the answers we want when we ask quetions. It might even be frustrating at times. Most of the time, this happens because of the way we ask our questions. They might not be specific enough, or we simply are not asking the question that will get us the answer we want. Some of us might have experienced this situation when seeking an answer from the DBC cohorts in the Cicadas Community. In fact I have experienced it. I was having thouble with a challenge and there was this part of it that I was not understanding. I didn't know how to do it, so I went to the community to get help. I probably expected a response that would tell me how to do the problem. I'm aware that in order to learn things well, I should be the one to discover the solutions. My question to the community was sort of asking for an orientation in the area. When I got a response, I was disappointed because I wanted a more detailed and specific answer, but I realized that in my question I only asked for orientation.

        Being able to undertand what our questiona are going to get us is very important. For any professional position, it is crucial to have good communication skills. Having details in our questions is very important, but the organization of our question is also necessary. The title of our question should be a summary of our question. Having correct punctuation and grammar is important too. While we are writing our questions keep in mind what you are expecting from that question. Read your own question and think about what you are asking. Is your question actually asking what you want it to ask? Is the question specific enough to make others understand your problem? All these things are very important for a question to be a good question.
