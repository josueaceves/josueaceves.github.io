 When I think of the times in my life where I been the happiest or the proudest, I feel a certain way that can be descrived with words. No matter who we are or where we come from, its always possible to live a good life. It possible to separte ourselves from the things that deviate our minds from what makes us feel good.

<ul ><h2>
<li>Activism</li>

<li>Excitement</li>

<li>Inspiration</li>

<li>Spirituality</li>

<li>Integrity</li>

<li>Courage</li>

<li>Freedom</li>

<li>Music</li>

<li>Persistence</li>

<li>Will-power</li>
</h2>
</ul>

  I looked through a list of values and looking through the list, I felt identified by the values above. For each value that I chose, I felt certain feeling as if my mind would travel through memories and found connections that made me re-live certain emmotions. If I rate these values from a 1-to-5 scale on how close I live to these values in my daily life, I would say 4 even though it may vary from time to time.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I was look looking though the whole list of values from which I chose the above, I saw a few that made me feel negative emotions like sadness or discourage. The values above are a representation of how I feel or the things that I feel identified with the most. The same way that by reading those words that represent an idea or a feeling that make us feel certain emotions, emotions can arise when we read or hear things that  remind us of something negative about.

  Some days for whatever reason we might feel negative about ourselves or about our surroundings. Somtimes we dont feel accepted or in connection with others. This can happen very often to some people and rearely for others. I wrote about stereotype threat in my last blog. I expalined about how when we are reminded of something that we might feel negative about, we become influenced by it. The best way to avoing feeling the threat is by lifting ourselves and remind us about those things that make us feel good. The same way something can put us down, something else can recover the stability in us.
