        So far, I have to say that I'm really enjoying to work with JavaScript. This is the second language that I ever begin to learn and Im excited for those to come. Javascript is similar to ruby in several ways. I think all languages might have their similarities. From the experience that I've had with ruby and JavaScript, I can say that looping is somewhat similar. What differentiates one from the other is the syntax.


    </p>
    <p>
       If we look at some examples of while loops and for loops in both ruby and JavaScript, we'll see that the concept is the same, but wrapped in defferent syntax. In JavaScript, its required to use parenthesis for the condition part of the loop and braces for the body of the fuction. Each of of a fuction of conditional parenthesis require a semicolon. For the most part it is crucial to add the semicolon becuase if you forget to add them, the fuction might not work properly.
     </p>
    <p>

    So lest say you want to loop through an array of numbers and you wan to add all values together. If we look at the ruby loop below you see that the loop is initiated with the term "while", and ended with "end". Also look how freely the look condition lays. It conatains no pathenthesis or curly braces.

      Now below you'll see that in javescript is a bit more strict in its format. the conditions and body have to be wrapped in parenthesis and braces.

    As you can see. JavaScript is a bit more strict when it comes to telling it when are argument ends. The semicolons tell JavaScript when an argument ends. Also notice the how both end their functions. Ruby ends its method with "end", and JavaScript with "};"
