 Humans have a tendency to follow beliefs and what others around us do. Its so common for people to form imaginary ideas of other people. So often minorities feel some sort of  denial from society. Stereotype threat is the effect of approaching a situation where one may feel at risk of confirming a negative characteristic in their group, race, or ethnicity. Studies proved that stereotype threat can affect students when they find themselves surrounded by other people who might subconsciously  be superior. Experiments have been conducted where a female student is placed in a classroom with male students to take an exam, and the female student scores lower in the exam than when put in another classroom mixed male, and female students. This also applies to race and ethnicity.

  Can you identify ways to change your behavior or the environment you're in to make it more welcoming and reduce the impact of stereotype threat?
  I  personally have been affected at some point by stereotype threat. When I was in elementary school, I would constantly be discriminated by white students who would disrespectfully criticize me for being Mexican. As a kid with little understanding, I let that discrimination affect me. For a long time I felt out of place and Im sure my grades could have been better. I felt misplaced when I found myself with white people. At the age of eight, I was vulnerable and week psychologically. Its not easy when at a young person receives that kind of discrimination from other people. There isnâ€™t really a definite stop to this psychological threat, but we can try to help those who might be at risk of being affected by it by making them feel welcomed and supported.
