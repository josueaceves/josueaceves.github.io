    <div id="Margin"><p>
        What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?
        Padding clears an area around the content. The padding is the transparent area around a picture or box. A border is what goes around the padding and content
        The margin clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent as well.<img src="josueaceves.github.io/blog/border.png"></p>

    <div id="classes"><p>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?
      Classes and Ids are particularly similar. They are both used for assigning values to elements. Classes are used for when you have a list of elements that you want to add the same value to. For example, if I have  three Divs and I want them all to be 400px by 400px, I would you a class instead of an id. To the ontrary if a have an div that i particularly want it to be color blue, then I use an id.</p>
</div>
<div id="positioning"><p>
What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?
    Relative positioning allows the content to relate itself to the values given within it. Absolute positioning, to the contrary, allows the content to be guided by the values of the previous element. For instance, if I have two divs; the first one with margin-left value of 40px, and i give absolute value to to the second element, the second element will inheret that same value for margin-left as the first div.</p>
</div>
    <div id="inline"><p>
    What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?
      Inline displays two alements as if they were one single element. For example if we write two paragrahs inline, they will stack up in eachother.<img src="josueaceves.github.io/blog/inline.png">
      If you sent the two paragraphs inline-block. they will become two blocks in line. <img src="josueaceves.github.io/blog/inline-block.png"></p>
