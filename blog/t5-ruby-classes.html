      When I first started reading about Ruby classes, I was so confused because the sentence description of a ruby class was not clear to me at all; "A class is like a blueprint that allows you to create objects of a particular type." What does that really mean? Understanding classes is not particularly easy. It takes some reading or a very good person to explain it. Imagine that a class is a factory which takes in a wood log and returns a carved wood sculpture. Now imagine a method that takes in a name and puts out a sentense that inlcudes that name in it.</p>

     <p>
      In the image above you see the class MakeNameASentence. The first method is a method called initialize. This method usually hold the parameter(input).
      The input is the name that will be put through the class. The class valible(@name) stores the parameter data from the initialize method.
     </p>
      <p>
       Now we have a class. How do we put it to work? Well, we have to create an instance of the class. So, we do this:
      </p>
      <p class = "line">
      name = class MakeNameASentence.new("your name")
    </p>
      <p class ="line"> Then we add the methor format_name: "me.format_name"</p>

      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
         The output then looks like this:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="http://josueaceves.github.io/blog/class2.png">
</p>

    <p>
        As you can see, the input that the initialize method takes in is being used. The class or factory that we created, is taking the name and returning a formated sentence. Classes can also take in a number and return a calculation of your choice.
