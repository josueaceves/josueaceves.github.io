  <div>
    <div>.each</div>
    <p>Each iterates through a data structure to access each element. Imagine an array of strings. Each is mostly used for accessing elements. You can modify and return a single element from the data structure without modifying the data structure itself.</p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <div>.map</div>
    <p>Map iterates through a data structure and effectuate the block. Lets say you have an array of numbers and you want to do something to each element; you then use .map to access and change the elements.</p>

  <div>
    <div>.slice</div>
    <p>Slice is a method used to delete elements from an array. Slice does not only delete an element. It also prints the element you chose to delete. You can also choose a range of elements to delete. At the end all the elements deleted are printed as a result.</p>

  <div>
    <div>.group_by</div>
    <p>The “group_by” method is, essentially, a way to collect all of the things that are similar in an array and group them together in a hash. For more information on the difference between arrays and hashes take a look at my blog here. So, for example, if we want to look at all of the similarly long words in an array we would write something like this.</p>
