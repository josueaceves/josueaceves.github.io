      <p>
        I am originally from Guadalajara, Jalisco Mexico. At a young age my family moved to the U.S. I lived about nine years of my life in Nipomo, CA. Since 2014 we moved to the city of Santa Maria.

      I graduated from high school in 2011. After I graduated high school, I took six months off to work, then after that I begun going to college. I attended Allan Hancock College. Two years later I came back to work, but I discovered a strong interest in software. I heard about Devbootcamp and decided that thats what I wanted to do and I became part of it and begun this awesome journey to the world of programming.

       I discoved an interest in music at the age of 14. Thats when I decided to learn to play musical instruments. I also learned how to sing. I even joined a choir in a church. As I grew up I had interests in things that were not so common in the city I lived in. I begun to learn the art of body-movement. Something called Parkour and freerunnig had captured my total attention at the age of 15. I begun doing parkour and freerunning as a life style. It because somthing I would do for abour one hour every day after school and before work. I developed some skills withing a few years both, in music, and sport.
